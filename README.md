DOS_Attack-Network_Simulator
============================

Denial of Service Attack simulation using ns2 in Network Simulator.

All the packets, i.e. requesting and attacking, are UDP packets with CBR traffic. Here calculation of packet arrival rate, packet drops and bottleneck
probabilities are also done.


Entropy Calculation
============================

Here requesting nodes are based on TCP and attacking nodes are based on
UDP. Used Entropy calculation to graphically display the time at which
the attack actually started.

First run prod_tcp.tcl and then run ddos.sh to see the output.
